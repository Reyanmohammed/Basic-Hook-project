Counter Project
Created a basic Counter project with the help of hooks where I've use useState, useState is one of the most fundamental and commonly used hooks in React. It allows functional components to manage state, which is data that can change over time and affect the component's rendering. Before hooks, state management was only possible in class components using this.state. With useState, functional components can now have stateful logic.
